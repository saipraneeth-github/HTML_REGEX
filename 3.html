Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer
grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on
your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries
special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can
tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance
are from, where they traveled and what happened to them
along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex
and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new
method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.</td>
<td>BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction
Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movementâ€”but
life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos.
The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym
offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the
hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood
and blues fusion.</td>
